Implement a single, reusable drawer component with the following specifications:

Drawer behavior:

The drawer must be either attached to the top of the viewport or the bottom of the viewport, depending on its usage.

The bottom drawer ("Continue in ChatGPT") must slide up from the bottom.

The top drawer ("QuickGPT Info") must slide down from the top.

The drawer must always stay fixed to its respective edge (top or bottom) and should not float or reposition elsewhere.

The drawer must open only when the user clicks on the corresponding glowing line at the top or bottom of the screen.

The opening and closing transitions must be smooth and consistent.

Size and scroll behavior:

The drawer must dynamically adjust its height based on the content it contains.

There must be no minimum height.

The drawer height must never exceed 90% of the viewport height.

If the content exceeds the maximum height, a vertical scrollbar must appear inside the textbox (for the bottom drawer) without affecting the drawer's layout.

Textbox behavior:

In the bottom drawer ("Continue in ChatGPT"), the textbox must be editable.

In the top drawer ("QuickGPT Info"), there must be no textbox. Text should be displayed normally, using standard text components, without input fields.

Visual continuity:

There must be no separator, border, or visual break between the textbox and the action buttons.

The layout must appear as a continuous block without visual interruptions.

Style guidelines:

The drawer must use a minimalistic, modern, and clean design.

Corners must be softly rounded at the top (for the bottom drawer) or at the bottom (for the top drawer).

Use a subtle box-shadow to create a slight elevation effect.

The drawer must be fully responsive and maintain a consistent appearance across different screen sizes.

Code requirements:

Code must be clean, organized, and easily maintainable.

Separate logical parts clearly (e.g., styling, component structure).

Use reusable styling where possible to avoid duplication.

Replace the two existing drawers ("Continue in ChatGPT" and "QuickGPT Info") with this new unified drawer component.
